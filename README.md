# Welcome to your how.fm coding challenge :wave:

This project was originally bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Refer to the original README `ReactAppREADME.md` to find out how to run the project using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) scripts.

Have fun and good luck :dizzy:

## Your steps today

1. Keep your _Reviewly_ countdown and submit page open.
   - You can find the link by clicking the _**`[Accept the invite]`**_ button in the _Reviewly_ invitation mail again.
2. Locate today's tasks:
   - Begin by reviewing the **open pull request** for an overview.
   - Each task is also listed as **open GitHub issue**.
   - For convenience, tasks are marked with **in-line comments**: `--- [TASK] ---`
3. Checkout the `feature`-branch (⚠ not `main`).
   - ⚠ We found out that tools like _GitHub Desktop_, _Kraken_ and similar might not work (due to GitHub Enterprise).
   - We recommend using _**`git-CLI`**_.
4. Make code changes and test them in the appplication and the storybook.
   - Run `yarn start` and `yarn storybook`.
   - Storybook is there for your convenience, allowing you to test components in isolation.
6. Constantly commit and push your changes.
   - Use your preferred IDE.
7. When finished, submit your results on your _Reviewly_ page.
   - Otherwise, Reviewly will automatically submit the pushed state.
